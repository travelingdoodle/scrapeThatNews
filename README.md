### What It Do
## A BIG FAT NOTHING BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS TO USE HANDLEBARS

This web application scrapes Lifehacker.com for 'How I Work' articles, displays them to the user and allows them to be saved. Users may make notes on saved articles, and delete them from their list of saved articles. Uses MongoDB, Mongoose, Express and Handlebars.

## Getting Started

```npm install --save```
Make sure mongo is running.
```node server.js```
